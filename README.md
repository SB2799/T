# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

This is a Basic Project showcasing how to work with React Router. I can use this foundational knowledge to build production project, this is just a sample. 

In this project I have made a nav bar containing links that will render different components.

this is not exactly done using styles fully , I have used bootstrap for layout and some class styles, will update it further should there be a need.

first link opens to home page
Second link opens to basic image and text
third link opens and renders a website containing product image and description. The data is fetched using api and takes few seconds to load

fourth link opens a basic user login. The user should enter all input fields and only then the button accepts the data and shows when it's clicked. 
User can also use Enter key to do the same with the same condition. 

The data is displayed with a remove button incase the user wants to change and enter new data. The user is alerted with a prompt that asks if the user wants to remove the data.
if the response is yes data is removed else it remains intact.

I will update further and add more links and depth to the page to make it more respnsive and user frendly.
